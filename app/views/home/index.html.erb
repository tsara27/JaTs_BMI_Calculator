<h1>What is BMI?</h1>
<p>The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure for human body shape based on an individual's mass and height.</p>
<p>The BMI is used in a wide variety of contexts as a simple method to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height.</p>

<h1>Why BMI is important?</h1>
<p>The body mass index, or BMI, is a calculation used to determine your level of body fat. It can help a doctor determine your overall fitness and your risk of developing chronic diseases.</p>

    this.fullName = ko.computed(function() {
        // Knockout tracks dependencies automatically. It knows that fullName depends on firstName and lastName, because these get called when evaluating fullName.
        return this.firstName() + " " + this.lastName();
    }, this);
};
 
ko.applyBindings(new ViewModel("Planet", "Earth")); // This makes Knockout get to work
